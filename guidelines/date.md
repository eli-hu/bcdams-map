### Access Guidelines

Enter the date of creation at the most specific level available.

Enter the date in [Extended Date/Time Format](http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf). Only enter valid EDTF dates.

__Early, late, and mid dates__

Where Y's represent the century or decade:

Dates | EDTF | Natural language | Example
------|------|-----------------|---------
Early __century__ | YY00~/YY30~ | approximately YY00-approximately YY30 | Early 18th century = 1700~/1730~ = approximately 1700-approximately 1730
Mid-century | YY30~/YY70~ | approximately YY30-approximately YY70 | Mid 19th century = 1830~/1870~ = approximately 1830-approximately 1870
Late century | YY70~/YY99~ | approximately YY70-approximately YY99 | Late 20th century = 1970~/1999~ = approximately 1970-approximately 1999
Early __decade__ | YYY0~/YYY3~ | approximately YYY0-approximately YYY3 | Early 1940s = 1940~/1943~ = approximately 1940-approximately 1943
Mid-decade | YYY3~/YYY7~ | approximately YYY3-approximately YYY7 | Mid 1950s = 1953~/1957~ = approximately 1943-approximately 1947
Late decade | YYY7~/YYY9~ | approximately YYY7-approximately YYY9 | Late 1940s = 1947~/1949~ = approximately 1947-approximately 1949

__Notes__
- In legacy data, you may see the natural language date "approximately 1920-1930." In EDTF, the "approximately" applies to the year directly following that word, so in this example, 1920 is considered approximate and 1930 is considered a known date. In EDTF, it would be expressed as 1920~/1930. To indicate that the entire range is approximate, you must indicate that each year is approximate, e.g. 1940~/1950~ which means "approximately 1940-approximately 1950."
- Season ranges (e.g. Spring-Summer 1997) are not supported in EDTF. To describe an item whose date is a range of seasons, put the year (1997) into the Date field and capture the range in the title ("Gulf Coast, Vol. 10, No. 2, Spring-Summer 1997").


### Preservation Guidelines

A date associated with the original item, usually the date of creation of the original.

For archival projects, data in this field is automatically populated from the date field (specifically, the ISO-normalized begin/end date fields) of the associated ArchivesSpace item. For standard projects, there is no data in this field.
